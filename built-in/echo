with -n --> Do not print the trailing newline
           character.  This may also be
           achieved by appending `\c' to the
           end of the string, as is done by
           iBCS2 compatible systems.  Note that
           this option as well as the effect of
           `\c' are implementation-defined in
           IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (``POSIX.1'')
           as amended by Cor. 1-2002.  Applica-
           tions aiming for maximum portability
           are strongly encouraged to use
           printf(1) to suppress the newline
           character.
